# Template Driven Form in Angular JS

Template-driven forms are suitable for small or simple forms, while reactive forms are more scalable and suitable for complex forms. For a comparison of the two approaches, see Introduction to Forms.

Template-driven forms use two-way data binding to update the data model in the component as changes are made in the template and vice versa.
